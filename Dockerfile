# If your composer.json file defines scripts that run during dependency installation and
# reference your application source files, uncomment the line below to copy all the files
# into this layer.
# COPY . .

# Download dependencies as a separate step to take advantage of Docker's caching.
# Leverage a bind mounts to composer.json and composer.lock to avoid having to copy them
# into this layer.
# Leverage a cache mount to /tmp/cache so that subsequent builds don't have to re-download packages.

# Create a new stage for running the application that contains the minimal
# runtime dependencies for the application. This often uses a different base
# image from the install or build stage where the necessary files are copied
# from the install stage.
#
# The example below uses the PHP Apache image as the foundation for running the app.
# By specifying the "8.1-apache" tag, it will also use whatever happens to be the
# most recent version of that tag when you build your Dockerfile.
# If reproducability is important, consider using a specific digest SHA, like
# php@sha256:99cede493dfd88720b610eb8077c8688d3cca50003d76d1d539b0efc8cca72b4.
FROM php:8.1-apache as final

# Your PHP application may require additional PHP extensions to be installed
# manually. For detailed instructions for installing extensions can be found, see
# https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/php#how-to-install-more-php-extensions
# The following code blocks provide examples that you can edit and use.
#
# Add core PHP extensions, see
# https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/php#php-core-extensions
# This example adds the apt packages for the 'gd' extension's dependencies and then
# installs the 'gd' extension. For additional tips on running apt-get, see
# https://docs.docker.com/go/dockerfile-aptget-best-practices/
# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
#     libfreetype-dev \
#     libjpeg62-turbo-dev \
#     libpng-dev \
# && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
#     && docker-php-ext-configure gd --with-freetype --with-jpeg \
#     && docker-php-ext-install -j$(nproc) gd
#
# Add PECL extensions, see
# https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/php#pecl-extensions
# This example adds the 'redis' and 'xdebug' extensions.
# RUN pecl install redis-5.3.7 \
#    && pecl install xdebug-3.2.1 \
#    && docker-php-ext-enable redis xdebug

# Use the default production configuration for PHP runtime arguments, see
# https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/php#configuration
RUN mv "$PHP_INI_DIR/php.ini-production" "$PHP_INI_DIR/php.ini"

# Copy the app dependencies from the previous install stage.
COPY --from=deps app/vendor/ /var/www/html/vendor
# Copy the app files from the app directory.
COPY . /var/www/html

# Switch to a non-privileged user (defined in the base image) that the app will run under.
# See https://docs.docker.com/go/dockerfile-user-best-practices/
